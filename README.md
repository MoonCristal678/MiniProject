# MiniProject
Express Setup:
The code begins by importing the Express.js framework and initializing an Express application.

File System (fs) and Path Modules:
It imports the fs (file system) and path modules. fs.promises is used to perform asynchronous file operations with Promises.

Middleware Setup:
Express middleware is set up to handle URL-encoded and JSON data in requests. It also sets the view engine to EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for rendering dynamic HTML pages.

File Operation Functions:
Three asynchronous functions are defined for file operations: writeFile, readFile, and deleteFile. These functions use Promises to perform file read, write, and delete operations.

HTML Page Rendering:
A route is defined for the root URL (/) that renders an HTML page with buttons to perform various file operations. It also includes JavaScript functions to redirect to different routes when the buttons are clicked.

API Version 1 Routing:
A router (v1Router) is created to handle API endpoints and rendering pages related to user data. It includes routes for:
/api/users: Returns a JSON response of user data after simulating a delay.
/add: Renders a form for adding a user.
/api/users (POST): Adds a new user to the JSON data after simulating a delay.
/read: Renders a page for reading a file.
/read (POST): Reads a file and renders its content on the page.
/write: Renders a page for writing content to a file.
/write (POST): Writes content to a file.
/delete: Renders a page for deleting a file.
/delete (POST): Deletes a file.

Error Handling Middleware:
An error handling middleware is defined to catch and handle any errors that occur during request processing. It logs errors and sends a generic error response.

Async and Promises:
Async Functions: For example, functions like readFile, writeFile, and deleteFile are declared as async because they perform file operations, which are inherently asynchronous. This allows you to use await inside these functions to wait for promises to resolve before proceeding.

Promises:In this code, fs.promises provides promise-based versions of file system operations (readFile, writeFile, unlink), making it easier to work with asynchronous file operations. Promises are used to handle file reading, writing, and deleting.

Callbacks:
For example, when a file operation (e.g., reading a file) is completed, a callback function can be invoked with the result. In this code, Promises are used instead of traditional callbacks to handle asynchronous file operations, making the code more readable and maintainable.

Event Loop:
In this code, when you perform asynchronous operations like reading, writing, or deleting files, Node.js doesn't block the main thread. Instead, it offloads these operations to the event loop and continues processing other tasks. When the asynchronous operation is completed, the event loop triggers the associated callback (or resolves a promise), allowing the code to continue.

This event-driven architecture is what enables Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent requests without becoming unresponsive.

Server Start:
Finally, the server is started on port 3000, and a message is logged to indicate that the server is running.
Overall: You can create, write to, delete, and read a file. You can also view a list of json user data and add a name and age to it.
