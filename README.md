1. Create Files
You can create text files by specifying a file name and its content. After entering the required information, click the "Create File" button to add the file to the list of created files.

2. Read Files
The app allows you to read the content of previously created files. Enter the file name you want to read, and click the "Read File" button. If the file exists, its content will be displayed; otherwise, a "File not found" message will be shown.

3. Delete Files
You can delete files that you no longer need. Each file in the list of created files is accompanied by a "Delete" button. Click this button to remove the file from the list.

4. Add User Data
This application also manages a list of users. You can add users to the JSON data by providing a name and an age. Users are assigned unique IDs automatically. Click the "Add User" button to include the new user in the JSON data.

5. JSON Data Display
The app displays the JSON data containing user information, showing each user's ID, name, and age. You can view this data in the "JSON Data" section of the app.
JSX Syntax:

The code uses JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax to create the user interface elements. JSX is a fundamental part of React that allows developers to define the structure and layout of the application's UI using a syntax that closely resembles HTML. It's utilized throughout the code to define the various components and elements of the user interface.

Functional and Class Components:

The code includes both functional and class components. The main component, App, is a class component that manages the state and lifecycle of the application. Within the render method of the App component, functional components are used to define different sections of the user interface. This combination of class and functional components is a common pattern in React applications.

Props and State:

The code makes use of React's state management system. It defines and updates component state using the this.state object, which is initialized in the component's constructor. State variables, such as fileName, fileContent, and jsonData, are used to store and manage data that can change over time. This allows for dynamic updates to the UI as state changes.

Event Handling:

Event handling mechanisms are implemented throughout the code. Event handlers are defined for various user interactions, such as creating files, reading files, deleting files, and adding users. For instance, the handleCreateFile function is called when the "Create File" button is clicked, and it processes the user's input and updates the state accordingly.
