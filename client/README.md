# File Operations React App

This React application provides a simple yet functional interface for performing file operations and managing JSON data. It leverages the power of React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and side effects.

## Features

### Create File

- To create a new file, enter a unique file name and its content.
- If either the file name or content is missing, you'll be alerted to provide both.
- Click "Create File" to add the file to the list of created files.

### Read File

- To read the content of a previously created file, input the name of the file.
- If the specified file exists, its content will be displayed.
- If not, you'll see a "File not found" message.

### Delete File

- You can delete files from the list of created files by clicking the "Delete" button next to the file name.
- If the selected file exists, it will be removed from the list of created files.

### Add User to JSON Data

- To add a new user entry to the JSON data, enter the user's name and age.
- If you forget to provide either the name or age, an alert will remind you to enter both.
- The new user entry is then displayed in the JSON data section.

### JSON Data Display

- The application displays a list of users from the JSON data, including their IDs, names, and ages.

## Technology Stack

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

## How to Use

1. Start the application and open it in your web browser.
2. Use the provided input fields and buttons to perform the various file operations and data management actions.

## Acknowledgments

This application serves as a practical example of a React-based user interface for handling file operations and managing data. Feel free to explore and customize the code to meet your specific requirements. Enjoy using the File Operations React App!

### Import Statements

The code begins by importing the necessary modules and functions from React:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

- `useState` and `useEffect` are hooks provided by React for managing state and handling side effects in functional components.

### Functional Component

The code defines a functional component named `App`. In functional components, state can be managed using the `useState` hook. Here's how `useState` is used in this component:

### `useState` for Managing State Variables

1. **Creating State Variables**

   The code defines several state variables using the `useState` hook. For each state variable, there is a corresponding setter function that allows updating the state.

   - `fileName` and `setFileName`: Manages the input value for the file name.
   - `fileContent` and `setFileContent`: Manages the input value for the file content.
   - `readFileName` and `setReadFileName`: Manages the input value for the name of the file to be read.
   - `readContent` and `setReadContent`: Stores and displays the content of the read file.
   - `createdFiles` and `setCreatedFiles`: Maintains a list of created files.
   - `jsonData` and `setJsonData`: Stores and displays JSON data.
   - `newName` and `setNewName`: Manages the input value for the name of a new user to be added to JSON data.
   - `newAge` and `setNewAge`: Manages the input value for the age of a new user to be added to JSON data.

2. **Setting Initial State**

   The `useState` hook is used to set the initial values of these state variables to empty strings or empty objects, depending on the variable's purpose.

### `useEffect` for Fetching Data

The code uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch JSON data when the component mounts. This is done in the `useEffect` block:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchJsonData() {
    // ...
  }

  fetchJsonData();
}, []);
```

- `useEffect` takes two arguments: a function to execute and an array of dependencies.
- The provided function (`fetchJsonData`) performs an asynchronous request to fetch JSON data.
- The empty dependency array (`[]`) ensures that the function runs only once when the component mounts.

In summary, `useState` is used to create and manage state variables that store various data, and `useEffect` is used for fetching external data when the component is mounted. These hooks enable the component to handle state and side effects in a clean and functional manner.
